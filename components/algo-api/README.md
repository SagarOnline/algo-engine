# Algo Core

The **Algo Core** component is the central engine for **algorithmic trading**.  
It provides functionality for both **backtesting** strategies using historical data and **executing live trades** through broker integrations.

---

## üìå Overview

- **Backtesting**  
  Uses the historical market data provided by the [`historical-data`](../historical_data/README.md) component to simulate strategies, analyze performance, and optimize trading rules.

- **Live Trading**  
  Connects to brokers such as **Upstox** and **Zerodha** to:
  - Fetch real-time instrument price feeds.
  - Execute buy/sell orders based on strategy signals.
  - Manage positions and monitor PnL.

- **Strategy Integration**  
  Allows you to define trading strategies that can run in either backtest mode or live execution mode.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Core engine for running strategies in **backtest** or **live** mode.
- Integration with multiple brokers (currently supports **Upstox** and **Zerodha**).
- Modular architecture to allow easy extension for new brokers.
- Unified interface for strategy developers (write once, run in both backtest and live).
- Logging and error handling for trade execution and data feeds.

Navigate to the algo-core project directory:  

```bash
cd components/algo-core
```

Create Vitual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Create Environment File (for developement)
```bash
python - <<EOF
CONFIG_JSON_PATH=../../config/config.json
"""
with open(".env", "w") as f:
    f.write(content)
EOF

```

Install dependencies ( for production ):  

```bash

### Running the Flask API Locally

1. Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Start the Flask API server:

   ```bash
   python ./src/algo_core/app.py # On Windows: python .\src\algo_core\app.py
   ```
   By default, the API will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Testing the Backtest API Endpoint

**Endpoint:**

```
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/backtest
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Sample JSON Request:**

```json
{
  "strategy_name": "bullish_nifty",
  "start_date": "2025-08-01",
  "end_date": "2025-08-14"
}
```

**Example cURL Command:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/backtest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"strategy_name": "bullish_nifty", "start_date": "2025-08-01", "end_date": "2025-08-14"}'
```

The response will be a JSON object containing the backtest report or error details.
