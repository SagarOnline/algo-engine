# Algo Core

The **Algo Core** component is the central engine for **algorithmic trading**.  
It provides functionality for both **backtesting** strategies using historical data and **executing live trades** through broker integrations.

---

## üìå Overview

- **Backtesting**  
  Uses the historical market data provided by the [`historical-data`](../historical_data/README.md) component to simulate strategies, analyze performance, and optimize trading rules.

- **Live Trading**  
  Connects to brokers such as **Upstox** and **Zerodha** to:
  - Fetch real-time instrument price feeds.
  - Execute buy/sell orders based on strategy signals.
  - Manage positions and monitor PnL.

- **Strategy Integration**  
  Allows you to define trading strategies that can run in either backtest mode or live execution mode.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Core engine for running strategies in **backtest** or **live** mode.
- Integration with multiple brokers (currently supports **Upstox** and **Zerodha**).
- Modular architecture to allow easy extension for new brokers.
- Unified interface for strategy developers (write once, run in both backtest and live).
- Logging and error handling for trade execution and data feeds.
